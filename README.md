# Typst concealer

A simple neovim plugin that uses the new(ish) kitty unicode rendering protocol thing to render typst expressions inline.

Very experimental etc

## Known issues
- It doesn't actually hide the text beneath images properly, so sometimes it's visible
- It doesn't unconceal stuff when it is being edited with insert mode
- It is weird
